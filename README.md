# Statistical Considerations in Testing

 You might think that the importance of statistics in experiment design lies only in analyzing the results of an experiment but in reality there's actually more importance for statistics in your experimental design rather than just coming in at the end.  

As known Factors like how much data  we will need before we can judge our experiment's success on solid grounds and the size of the effect that you want to see can have a major effect on how much data you need to collect and how long it will take before you get your results In this Repos  

* you'll learn about how statistical techniques can help you answer questions related to setting up an experiment. 

* you'll learn about some tricky pitfalls that can come as a part of enlightened outcomes of an experiment.

 In most experiments, If the probability of something  that happened by chance is less than 5% or less than 1% then the probability would definitely significant. please check out [this notebook]() to get more onformation.
